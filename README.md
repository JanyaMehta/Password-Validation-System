Password Validation System

=>Building a Secure Password Checker
=>Import the requests module for handling HTTP requests.
=>Define the Password API URL to interact with.
=>Implement initial request using the password "123" and encounter errors due to incorrect API usage.
=>Explain the importance of hashing for security and demonstrate SHA1 hash generation for the password "123".
=>Introduce the concept of one-way hashing and emphasize sending hashed passwords for security.
=>Introduce K anonymity technique by sending only the first five characters of hashed passwords.
=>Develop a program to check if passwords were compromised, utilizing hashlib for SHA1 hashing and handling API requests.
=>Prepare and send SHA1 password to the API for verification, ensuring proper handling of response status.
=>Continue building the tool, discussing further steps such as Pond API check and finalizing functions.
=>Highlight the significance of debugging skills and thorough testing with different passwords for functionality assurance.
